I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Product Manager for Growth position at Adobe. Having followed Adobe's innovative work, I am particularly drawn to this role's potential to significantly impact user acquisition and engagement.\n\nMy career has been centered around leading product initiatives and driving measurable outcomes. As a Product Manager at Axis Bank, I've honed my skills in strategic planning, market analysis, and product lifecycle management. Prior to this, my experience as a Team Lead at J. Edgerton Consulting (04/2015 - 04/2022) and Resolutions Team Lead at Mount Rose Technologies (10/2010 - 03/2015) further developed my leadership and team management capabilities, both critical for a growth-focused role.\n\nI possess a robust skill set that aligns well with the requirements for a Senior Product Manager for Growth, including strong leadership and teamwork, effective time management, customer service, and communication skills. My knowledge of digital performance metrics and risk management has consistently enabled me to make data-driven decisions that propel product success. I am also proficient in multiple languages (English, Spanish, Polish, French), which could be a valuable asset in a global organization like Adobe.\n\nI am confident that my experience and passion for driving product growth would allow me to make significant contributions to Adobe. I have attached my resume for your review and would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your team. Please let me know if a brief call would be possible at your convenience.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nGautham Madhu\ngauthammadhu27@gmail.com",
